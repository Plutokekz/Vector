* Man hat ein gutes Argument Arrays nict zu nutzen.
* Matrizen und Vektoren direkt auf dem Keller -> No heap needed if sizes are known at compile time
* What to do if 32 registers * 128 are not enough for the matrix / vector size?
* TODO for the project: present RISC V vector extension
* TODO optional: use case, such as ML super small / short application example
* TODO: leaverage paralelization, nice property in linear algebra
* Ausblick question: does RISC V allow for using multiple RAMs?
